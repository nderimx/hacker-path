# Hacker Path and Notes

## This is me figuring out a solid learning path for hacking while I learn myself

1. While learning or solving anything, always Take Organised Notes that you can refer to later (using something like obsidian, notion, etc.)
2. Learn Linux
3. Learn a Scripting Language
4. Complete Rooms in tryhackme.com (start with the fundamentals)
5. Play CTFs & Wargames (events organised near you, picoctf.org, ctftime.org, vulnhub.com, hackthebox.com, tryhackme.com, etc)
6. Decide where you want to specialize (nexts steps will be for: Bug Bounty Hunting using Code Analysis & Pentesting)
7. Read & Follow along: Hacking: the Art of Exploitation - Jon Erickson
8. Read & Follow along: Penetration Testing - Georgia Weidman
9. R&Fa: C the Programming Language - Ritchie & Kernighan
10. The Shellcoder's Handbook - Chris Anley, Felix Lindner, & John Heasman
11. ....
